Revisit Linear regression with more mathematical backing this time (from mml)

"we will adopt a probabilistic approach and explicitly model the noise using a likelihood function." -> probabilistic approach of solving linear regression 

1. Maximum likihood estimation
2. Maximum Likelihood Estimation with Features
3. Maximum A Posteriori Estimation

4. Orthogonal Basis transformation
