## Introduction 

Imagine you are right now, from where you are sitting/standing/running right now. Transported to a completely different world. And as soon as you enter you are labelled a wizard. The people reverve you because you are the first person in this world to have a "Curious Mind". {Introduce this idea later perhaps}

This world is beautiful and almost perfect. The people are kind, There is lots of grenery & lots of animals. But you quickly notice one thing, they do not have huge buildings but rather haphard huts, they do not have a concept of money but a batter system. 

In this world the concept of mathematics does not exist, because no curious mind like euler, fauss, libneitze was ever born here. 

So it is upto you now, to be CURIOUS (The thing you are best at) and introduce the magic of mathematics to this world.

## Introductory Maths

This section is supposed to be skipped by most people, 

{talk about numbers, negative, poisitive, operations, properties, basic geometry}

## Linear Algebra 

### Vectors

Different disciplines have different definition of a vector, but as this is maths for ml. We will primarily follow the mathematical definition. That being, a vector is something that follows the triangle law of addition 

### System of linear equations 

### Matrices 

##### Matrix Addition & multiplication 
Associativity, Distributivity, Multiplication with the identity matrix (types of matrices)

#### Inverse and Transpose

#### Multiplication by a Scalar

###  Solving Systems of Linear Equations

### Vector Space

### Linear Independence 

### Basis and Rank

### Linear Mappings 

### Affine spaces 


## Probability 


## Statistics 

## Geometry

### Norm 

### Inner products

#### Dot product

## Matrix
