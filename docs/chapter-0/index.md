# Chapter 0

Introduction to fundamental mathematics for machine learning.

This chapter can be skipped by most people, as we introduce simple mathematics that is taught till high school. 
If you are someone who finds Maths boring, or annoying. Then start with this chapter. If not, SKIP IT. 

Let us begin !!

## Introduction 

Imagine you are right now, from where you are sitting/standing/running right now. Transported to a completely different world.

This world is beautiful and almost perfect. The people are kind, There is lots of grenery & lots of animals. But you quickly notice one thing, they do not have huge buildings but rather haphard huts, they do not have a concept of money but a batter system.

In this world the concept of mathematics does not exist, because no curious mind like euler, fauss, libneitze was ever born here. 

And as soon as you enter you are labelled a wizard. The people revere you because you are the first person in this world to have a "Curious Mind".

So it is upto you now, to be CURIOUS (The thing you are best at) and introduce the magic of mathematics to this world.
