Mean & Variance 
Distributions -> Random, Normal, Binomial etc 
Expectation 
covariance 
Correlation

Add remark, or real life scenario. Where when it comes to a bet, fair bets have an expectation of 0, and investing etc should have an expectation > 0, otherwise you may become a lucky fool at times, but due to regression to the mean. You will eventually make such a huge loss you will be under waters soon enough.
